### GPU drivers
  - amd-ati-RADV.sh = For all AMD and ATI cards. It includes the RADV vulkan driver whitch is partially developed by valve and has often better performance to AMDVLK.
  - amd-AMDVLK.sh = For AMD RDNA gpus and up(RX 5000+).It includes the AMDVLK vulkan driver from AMD. It may work better in certin situations. (Less Reccomended)
  - Switch-to-AmdGPU-GCN1.sh = Enable AMDGPU drivers for GCN1 GPUS. Performs better in GPU intensive situations. Has better support. May be more CPU intensive. Disables VGA output from DVI-I adapters(is being worked on). 
  - intel-gpu-drivers.sh = for all intel GPUS. 
  - nvidia390-Fermi.sh = For nvidia 400 and 500 series. Some Fremi gpus may have 600 or 700 naming(eg. GT 710M). Open CPU-x and consult with techpowerup. You must select linux 6.1 at startup.
  - nvidia470-Kepler.sh = For nvidia 600 and 700 series. Some 600 and 700 series may be have Fermi chip, consult CPU-x and Techpowerup. You must select linux 6.12 at startup.
  - nvidia-New-Stable.sh = New stable nvidia driver. For GTX 900 and 1000 series and newer. Soon will only support only RTX 2000 and GTX 1600 series and newer.
  - nvidia-Nouveau-drivers.sh = FOSS driver for Nvidia. For any nvidia card. Will work better on older GPUS.
  - emulate-vulkan-lavapipe.sh = is for Non vulkan cards like amd Terrascale, Intel HD 3000 and older, Nvidia only when using nouveau. It uses CPU to emulate Vulkan.
