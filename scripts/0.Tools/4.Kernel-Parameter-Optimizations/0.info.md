# Kernel Optimiazations
- Kernel optimizations offer better performance often at the cost of lower stability and security 
- The scripts will set theese kernel parameters in grub located in file /etc/default/grub on line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=" <kernel_parameters>"
- Any exisitng parameters that you have added manually will be left alone. 
- In every section (exluding presets) there is a manuall selection procces.
- To select press the space-bar. To apply them press tab and then enter. 


## kernel-parameter-TUI-config.sh
- TUI for setting Kernel parameters set in kernel_params.confabs
- You can either enable or disable them

## 1.Presets
### Intel-Specter-Meltdown.sh
- For Intel cpus 10gen and older. (11gen and newer may see performance decreese)
- Works on AMD Ryzen aswell but it may decreese performance. (Older AMD not tested)
- Disables Specter and Meltdown witch are high security risks. 
- DO NOT RUN ON SERVER OR ANY MISSION CRITICAL MACHINES!!!
- list of parameters:
    - mitigations=off

### AMD-Ryzen-optimizations.sh
- For AMD ryzen procesors(it will probaly work on any cpu and ignore what is not for )
- Tries to enable amd_pstate driver and set it to active. 
- ENABLE CPPC IN BIOS FOR THIS TO WORK THE BEST
- nowatchdog will decreese performance
- list of parameters:
    - amd_pstate.shared_mem=1 
    - amd_pstate=active

### 2.Performance-kernel-parameter-config.sh
List of parameters:
- mitigations=off
- nowatchdog | Disables the system's watchdog timers, which are used to detect and recover from system hangs. Dsiableing it  can prevent "jitter" or inconsistent performance spikes.
- noreplace-smp | Disables running Single threaded processes on Multiple cores. can reduce boot complexity
- page_alloc.shuffle=1 | Randomizes the page allocator's freelist. This can improve security by making memory allocation patterns less predictable, and in some workloads it may improve performance by reducing memory hot-spotting.
- rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1 | Speeds up Read-Copy-Update (RCU) grace periods. This can improve responsiveness on systems with many CPUs, but may slightly increase CPU usage at idle.
- clocksource=tsc | Forces TSC as the time source for reduced jitter.
- tsc=reliable | Forces the kernel to trust the Time Stamp Counter for timekeeping. Mostly useful for low-latency workloads or audio production.
- amd_pstate.shared_mem=1 
- amd_pstate=active
- intel_pstate=disable | Disables Intel's pstate CPU frequency driver, forcing the kernel to use acpi-cpufreq. Sometimes useful for overclocked or unstable Intel CPUs.

### 3.Virt-kernel-parameter-config.sh
List of parameters:
- amd_iommu=on | enable amd iommu groups
- iommu=pt | 
- modprobe.blacklist=nouveau | Blacklist the open source nvidia driver
- modprobe.blacklist=radeon | Blacklist the ati radeon driver for older cards (Terrascale 1/2/3)
- modprobe.blacklist=amdgpu | Blacklist the open amdgpu driver
- modprobe.blacklist=i915 | Blacklist the Intel driver

### 4.Debug-kernel-parameter-config.sh
List of parameters:
- cryptomgr.notests | Skips the self-tests for cryptographic algorithms and modules at boot. Speeds up the boot process. 
- acpi=off | Disables ACPI entirely (old hardware only).
- pci=nomsi | Disables MSI interrupts, useful for some broken PCIe devices.
- libata.force=noncq | Disables NCQ on SATA devices to fix drive issues.
- irqpoll | Forces polling of interrupt lines, useful for some broken hardware.

### 5.Power-kernel-parameter-config.sh
List of parameters:
- pcie_aspm=force | Forces PCIe Active State Power Management even if firmware says it's unsupported. Can lower power usage at the cost of potential instability.
- pcie_aspm=off | Disables PCIe ASPM entirely; useful for stability in some PCIe devices at the cost of more power draw.
- intel_idle.max_cstate=1 | Prevents Intel CPUs from entering deep idle states, reducing latency at the cost of higher idle power usage.
- processor.max_cstate=1 | Similar to above but works for ACPI driver.
- nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0 | Forces NVMe drives to stay in the lowest-latency power state.

### 6.Memory-kernel-parameter-config.sh
List of parameters:
- zswap.enabled=0 bn
